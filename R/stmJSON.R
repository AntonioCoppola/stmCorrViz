#   The stmJSON function is a top-layer function that outputs a nested JSON
#   structure for use in D3 visualizations of an STM model. The overall procedure
#   is as follows (for greater detail, refer to the comments in the individual
#   subroutines):
#     1. The routine retrieves the theta matrix from the STM object, then computes
#        the correlation of topics based on it, hence uses correlation to compute
#        distances among topics, and finally performs a hierarchical clustering of
#        the topics (this is achieved by calling hclust).
#     2. The algorithm then finds all binary splits in the middle of the hierarchical
#        clustering tree whose clustering height measure is below a user-specified
#        clustering threshold. All these splits are marked as "aggregation points".
#     3. The routine retrieves the merge matrix from the output of hclust, and 
#        produces a new merge list (with the same conventions) by getting rid of
#        all the splits performed at aggregation points along the tree. While the
#        hclust merge matrix only contains binary splits, the new merge list can
#        (and presumably will) contain non-binary cluster splits. The subroutine
#        collapseMergedList() is used to complete this step in the procedure.
#     4. The merge list is turned into a structure of nested lists with a recursive
#        function call. Each level of this nested structure corresponds to a
#        node in the hierarchical representation of the STM model. The terminal
#        nodes are topics. Topics are children to clusters. Each terminal node is
#        represented as a list of two elements: name and size. Each non-terminal
#        node is a list of two elements: name, and a list of children.
#     5. Lastly, the nested-list stucture is turned into a JSON object by using the
#        rjson library.
#     6. The assignClusterNames() subroutine is used for assigning labels to
#        clusters. This is currently non-functional.
